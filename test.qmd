## Lesson

### Background

Having multiple pages and a way to navigate them allows the developer to separate content and ideas and benefits the user with an organizational structure that is familiar. A navigation bar is a fundamental element of website design that plays a crucial role in helping users navigate, understand, and interact with the content and features of a site or application.


### Creating a New Page

Step one is to create a new .qmd document that will become our new page. This should be a review from Unit 2 Lesson 2. 

- Create a quarto file by clicking the new file icon at the top-left in VSCode or right-clicking in the folder and selecting new file. Give the page file a name and end with .qmd

- Add a title in the YAML and some markdown content underneath like such:

### Linking the New Page to the YAML

Step two is changing our metadata file, by default this will be named _quarto.yml. This file is referred to as a YAML. A YAML is used to specify various settings and configurations related to the document's formatting, layout, styling, and other properties.

After these changes push your work to git hub as shown in Unit 2 Lesson 3 and your website should update. You have now successfully connected your new page to the website! It should look something like this:
