    "text": "Lesson\n\nBackground\nHaving multiple pages and a way to navigate them allows the developer to separate content and ideas. This benefits the user with an organizational structure that is familiar. A navigation bar is a fundamental element of website design that plays a crucial role in helping users navigate, understand, and interact with the content and features of a site or application. By default your webiste will be built with a nav bar. This lesson will teach you how to add content and customize the nav bar.\n\n\nCreating a New Page\nStep one is to create a new .qmd document that will become our new page. This should be a review from Unit 2 Lesson 2. Make sure to add this file to your already existing website that you created in a previous lesson.\n\nCreate a quarto file by clicking the new file icon at the top-left in VSCode or right-clicking in the folder and selecting new file. Give the page file a name and end with .qmd\n\n\n\n\ncreating a qmd document\n\n\n\nAdd a title in the YAML and some markdown content underneath like such:\n\n\n\n\nadding title and content\n\n\n\n\nLinking the New Page to the YAML\nStep two is changing our metadata file, by default this will be named _quarto.yml. This file is referred to as a YAML. A YAML is used to specify various settings and configurations related to the document’s formatting, layout, styling, and other properties.\n\n\n\nlinked file in yaml\n\n\nStep three is to now render or preview your index.html file after everthing is connected and saved. This allows quarto to output the html files and all other supporting files that creates our website.\nAfter these changes push your work to git hub as shown in Unit 2 Lesson 3 and your website should update. You have now successfully connected your new page to the website! It should look something like this:\n\n\n\nweb page example\n\n\nNow we will explore formatting options so you can customize your website to your personal preferences.\n\n\nFormatting\n\nNavigation Bar\nYour _quarto.yml page contains the informaiton on how you want the webite formated. By default the website uses a navigation bar oriented at the top of the page. And should look like the image on your right.\n\n\nwebsite:\n  title: \"Quarto Website\"\n  navbar:\n    left:\n      - href: index.qmd\n        text: Home\n      - about.qmd\n      - newpage.qmd\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMenu\nIf we don’t like the default nav bar we can do a couple things to change it. Notice in the code below I use right: this will take the contents of our nav bar and align them right. Next I added a menu item that will create a dropdown with all of our pages title Menu. Note you can create multiple menus for your website.\n\n\nwebsite:\n  title: \"Quarto Website\"\n  navbar:\n    right:\n    - text: 'Menu'\n      menu:\n        - href: index.qmd\n          text: Home\n        - about.qmd\n        - newpage.qmd\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSide Bar\nIf we want a side bar as opposed to a nav bar all we need to change is the navbar: to sidebar:. The style docked gives the navigation panel a gray background to seperate from the white page. You can remove this if you want it to blend with the page. Also not you need to specify the contents: for this code to work properly.\n\n\nwebsite:\n  title: \"Quarto Website\"\n  sidebar:\n    style: docked\n    contents: \n        - href: index.qmd\n          text: Home\n        - about.qmd\n        - newpage.qmd\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSections\nLastly If you want a similar effect like menu with the nav bar you need to use section:. Notive you can give you section a title right after the section: code, my section is titled Pages. Note you can have multiple secitons which would be beneficial to seperate your content.\n\n\nwebsite:\n  title: \"Quarto Website\"\n  sidebar:\n    style: docked\n    contents: \n      section: 'Pages'\n      contents: \n        - href: index.qmd\n          text: Home\n        - about.qmd\n        - newpage.qmd\n\n\n\n\nI recommend going to the Quarto website and seeing how you can turn the YAML parameters to continue to make your website personal.\nMore Details on navigation in quarto to be found here: https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-navigation.html\nNote: If you want to change the colors of your web page look into changing the theme: element in your YAML"
